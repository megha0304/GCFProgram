 ##Who can become a facilitator ?
:medal_military:	Every student who wishes to become a facilitator must be a University enrolled student or a working professional who has the knowledge of Cloud and it's resources. Appreantly you must be a good leader because you have to manage a large number of students hence, an interactive idea of how to manage should be there
##How and when to apply ?
:medal_military:	The facilitator INTEREST FORM is open throughout the year so you can apply anytime or wait for an official announcement which will be shared in our group.
Link is here : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXOKw5-abi9HgS2TnwUafoH1B-G3C-HXAghAlcQcnj69JL8w/viewform?pli=1
(this is the official link you can also find teh same link in the website : https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/arcade-facilitator/faqs )

## How to increase the chances of becoming a facilitator?
:medal_military:	 Only limited number of students are selected for this program so make sure that you have  a good and strong application!
Here are some most important questions and a demo answer (please do not copy/paste this in your application as it might lead to disqualification)
Why do you think you are the right person to become a "Facilitator"?
 Include about your leadership traits about your grit and things in the past that you have done as a leader like helping people and how often you are involved in community and problem solving. Tell them how it will be beneficial for you as well as for all the other students who will enroll in this program.
Have you ever driven/led any technical programs/societies/clubs in the past? If yes, then tell us more about what you did and how did you drive success.
 Explain if you have hosted any program or an event in your college or university and how did you manage it host it and everything that you think you did to make that event a success.
## What after filling the form ?
:medal_military:	Once you fill up the form you can get a rejection or an Congratulations mail.
After that you will receive another mail that says you to mention the name of the Co-facilitator, the name and the mail-id.This is a first come first serve so you need to reply to the mail within few days.
---Is it all ?----
No, once you mail them you will receive another official mail after 10-15 days..
"CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE A FACILITATOR" :trophy:	
Once you accept the terms and conditions you can share it on twitter and other social platforms with #GoogleCloud.
Another set of mails arrive in which one is for joining the Google Chat ( a platform where all the important information will be shared)
also another mail that for attending a Google Cloud Onboarding Session which is a mandatory session.

A brief about this program is given in this session. STILL THIS DOSEN'T MAKE YOU 100% SURE THAT YOU WILL BE A FACILTATOR THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM!
Once the session is completed you will be requested to complete a training, again it is a mandatory. So after completing this training you will start enrolling the students for the program.
This whole process takes upto 2-3 weeks and that's when you should start collecting students for the program.

## What are the best platforms to interact with students and how to manage an lead them.
:trophy:	Well the best practice is to go with a WhatsApp Community , A telegram channel or a Discord channel as per your wish.

## How to track the progress of students and facilitator?
Don't worry you will receive an official mail everyday so you can keep a track of everything and every student enrolled under you.

 ### Enjoy facilitating for next 2 months and share your swags :smiley:
